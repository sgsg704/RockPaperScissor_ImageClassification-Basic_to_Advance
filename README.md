## Description
The project will talk about the use of Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification of rock-paper-scissors images. To build the model, we will use Python with help of Tensorflow and Keras packages. Please refer here for the full notebook. Note that some of the packages might not work in Jupyter Notebook because I used Colab Notebook
